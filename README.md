# TSC English Academy

This is the static landing page for TSC English Academy. I added subtle motion and UI polish (logo sheen, hero/background parallax, card 3D tilt, heading sheen, keyboard accessibility, etc.).

How to preview locally:

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\SHINTAROGAB\TSC'
Start-Process .\index.html
# or run a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
Start-Process 'http://localhost:8000'
```

How to push to GitHub:

1. Create a repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new).
2. Add the remote and push:

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\SHINTAROGAB\TSC'
# SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo>.git
# or HTTPS
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

How to publish with a permanent link (GitHub Pages):

1. Push this project to GitHub (`main` branch).
2. Open GitHub repository settings: `Settings > Pages`.
3. In `Build and deployment`, select `Source: GitHub Actions`.
4. This repo already includes `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, so every push to `main` auto-deploys.
5. Public URL will be:

```text
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
```

For this repo name `TSC`, the URL format is:

```text
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/TSC/
```

If you want, provide the GitHub repo URL and I can add the remote and push from here (you must have auth set up).
